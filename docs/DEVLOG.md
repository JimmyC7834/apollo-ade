## Slice 1 — Empty Workbench Shell

**User outcome:** A desktop window with a custom titlebar and four empty
workbench regions that can be shown, hidden, and resized by mouse or keyboard.

**Added**

- Frameless window (`decorations: false`) with a custom titlebar
- Drag region and double-click-to-maximize
- Minimize, maximize/restore, close buttons, with maximize state read back from
  the window and re-synced on every resize rather than assumed
- Four regions: primary sidebar, main, secondary sidebar, bottom panel
- Pointer and keyboard resizing on all three separators
- Region visibility toggles
- Focus-safe region hiding
- Accessibility help dialog

**UI extracted:** `tokens.css`, `Icon`, `IconButton`, `Pane`,
`ResizableSeparator`, and the `src/ui/index.ts` barrel.

**Dependencies:** React 19, `@vscode/codicons`, `@vitejs/plugin-react@^4`
(pinned — v6 requires Vite 8, this project is on Vite 6). Tauri window
capabilities: `close`, `minimize`, `toggle-maximize`, `is-maximized`,
`start-dragging`.

**Security boundary:** unchanged. No new native surface; window controls only.

**Accessibility**

- Separators use `role="separator"` with `aria-orientation` and
  `aria-valuenow/min/max`; arrow keys resize in 20px steps, Home/End jump to
  min/max
- Every icon-only control has a label
- Hiding a region that holds focus moves focus to main
- Help dialog has modal semantics, a programmatic title, and Escape dismissal

**Validation performed:** `npm run build` passes. Browser-mode behavioral
checks for region landmarks, separator semantics, keyboard resize (including
inverted sashes), focus-safe hiding, and the help dialog open/close/reopen
cycle.

**Not validated:** anything native. `cargo` has never been run in this repo, so
the frameless titlebar, window buttons, and drag region are untested, and
`src-tauri/src/workspace.rs` has never compiled. Browser mode hides the window
controls by design.

**Two bugs found and fixed during validation**

1. A region's separator is a sibling of the region, not a child, so hiding a
   panel while its sash held focus stranded focus on `<body>`. Predicting which
   element is about to be destroyed proved fragile; focus is now repaired after
   the update instead — if the update left focus on nothing, it goes to main.
2. `<dialog>`'s `close` event never fires in the WebView used for testing
   (confirmed against a bare detached dialog). Syncing React state from that
   event desynced it, leaving the help permanently "open" and impossible to
   reopen. React is now the sole source of truth: `cancel` is prevented and
   every close routes through `onClose`. **This will affect any future
   overlay** — do not rely on the dialog's own close event.

**Caveats and deviations**

- Built out of order: `src/workspace.ts` and `src-tauri/src/workspace.rs`
  (Slice 4 material — real filesystem access) were written before this slice
  and are currently dormant and unimported. Slice 2 uses the fixture provider;
  Slice 4 switches the native path on.
- `WorkspaceProvider` is a subset of the guide's interface: `getFiles`,
  `writeFile`, `restoreWorkspace`, and `search` are missing.
- `AccessibilityHelp` uses a native `<dialog>` rather than the `Overlay`
  primitive, which the guide does not introduce until Slice 3. Marked with a
  `ponytail:` comment naming the upgrade path.
- No persistence: layout state resets on reload. Slices 7-8.
